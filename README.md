# Mentor App ReadMe
In order to start working on me, try out the following directions:
#### Clone me
`$ git clone https://github.com/TheWITProject/MentorApp.git`
#### Start by going into our freshly cloned repository:
`$ cd MentorApp/`
#### What files are in this repository?
`$ ls`
`LICENSE README.md`

#### Looks like i'm missing my `hello.py` file. What other branches could it be on?
`$ git branch -r`
`origin/HEAD -> origin/master`
`origin/develop`
`origin/master`

#### Let's check out *develop* and see if it's there.
`$ git checkout develop`
`Branch develop set up to track remote branch develop from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'develop'`
`$ ls`
`LICENSE  README.md  hello.py`

#### We've got it! And now for our first "Hello, World!"
`$ python hello.py`
`Hello World!`

#### You did it!
